# Shannon E. Scott  
### *Poetry Before I Disappear*

---

Poetry that lingers in the space between closeness and retreat.  
The body. The pause. The almost-confession.

I write into the quiet fractures inside love—  
where tenderness and restraint share the same breath.

My work returns often to effort, to movement, to endurance—  
and the private negotiations we make  
to stay,  
to leave,  
to soften.

I’m drawn to what remains unsaid.  
To the moment just before a truth becomes real.

A poem, to me, should feel like breath—  
held, released,  
and sometimes unfinished.
