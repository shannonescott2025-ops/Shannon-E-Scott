#### *Poetry before I disappear*

<br>

I write under a pseudonym.  

The work asks for distance — and for intimacy.  
The name allows both.

<br>

My poems explore the small fractures inside love —  
where closeness and hesitation share the same breath.  

I return often to the body — to effort, restraint, movement —  
and the private negotiations we make  
to stay,  
to leave,  
to soften.

<br>

I’m interested in what remains unsaid.  
In the pause before confession.  
In endurance as a form of tenderness.

<br>

I believe a poem should feel like breath —  
held, released,  
and sometimes unfinished.
